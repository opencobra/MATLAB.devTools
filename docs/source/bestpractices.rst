Best practices
==============

Naming a contribution
---------------------

Initiate a contribution per theme/topic/feature/bug fix that you work
on. Donâ€™t mix features and think of an explicit name, i.e.
``bug-fix-function1`` or ``add-tests-function2``. Avoid generic names,
such as ``my-great-feature`` or ``fix`` or ``contribution-myName``.

Submitting a Pull Request (PR)
------------------------------

Once you submit your contribution (menu option [3]), you will be
presented with a link that leads you directly to the pull request (PR).
Once the PR is submitted, wait until it is reviewed and accepted.
Once merged, please start a new branch by running ``contribute`` and
selecting [1] after your pull request has been reviewed and merged.
